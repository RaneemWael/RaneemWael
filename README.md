- 👋 Hi, I’m @RaneemWael. I'm a Conputer Science and Engineering undergraduate currently working as a teaching assistant at The German University in Cairo.

- 👀 I'm mostly interested in participating in unity based projects, whether they be games, websites or mobile applications.
  - I excel at developing games, applications and websites using C# and Unity.
  - However, I also enjoy coding in Java and have implemented a decent amount of projects in Eclipse.
  - Of the most noticeable Unity projects, you can find the "Serious Game for Detecting Social Processing Deficits" and the "Simplified Apex Legends" games.
  - In regards to the projects implemented in Java; "Database Engine" and "AI Matrix Plan Generator" are two of which I believe to be my best work.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning flutter to further develop my coding skills.
